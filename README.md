The objective of this project is to predict the survival of the Titanic Passengers

•	Analyzing the data using countplot library.

•	Cleaned the data by removing NAN values and unnecessary columns from the dataset.

•	Categorized the important string values to dummy variables using Pandas in order to implement Logistic Regression.

•	Splitting the dataset into training and testing data.

•	Used the logistic Regression to predict the test data.

•	Now we are calculating the accuracy as well as confusion matrix to check how the model is performing
